    "There are Python libraries that are made for working just with chemical data. One commonly used library in Python for data science (or cheminformatics) is called [RDKit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDKit). RDKit is an open-source cheminformatics library, primarily developed in C++ and has been under development since the year 2000. We will be using the Python interface to RDKit, though there are interfaces in other languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "RDKit provides a molecule object that allows you to manipulate chemical structures. It has capabilities for reading and writing molecular file formats, calculating molecular properties, and performing substructure searches. In addition, it offers a wide range of cheminformatics algorithms such as molecular fingerprint generation, similarity metrics calculation, and molecular descriptor computation. This notebook introduces RDKit basics, but we will see more of all of these topics in later notebooks.\n",

    "Most of this functionality is achieved through the RDKit `mol` object. In Python, we use the word \"object\" to refer to a variable type with associated data and methods. \n",
    "One example of an object we have seen in notebooks is a list - we could also call it a \"list object\". An object has `attributes` (data) and `methods`. \n",
    "You access information about objects with the syntax\n",
    "```python\n",
    "object.data\n",
